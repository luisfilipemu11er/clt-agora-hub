## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project leverages a robust stack of modern web and backend technologies:

**Frontend:**

-   **React:** A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
-   **Vite:** A fast frontend build tool that provides an excellent development experience.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
-   **Shadcn/ui:** A collection of re-usable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
-   **`react-router-dom`:** For declarative routing in React applications.
-   **`lucide-react`:** A beautiful and customizable icon library.
-   **`date-fns`:** A comprehensive JavaScript date utility library.
-   **`react-markdown` & `remark-gfm`:** For rendering Markdown content, especially in the AI chat.

**Backend:**

-   **Python:** The primary language for backend services.
-   **Flask:** A lightweight WSGI web application framework for Python, likely used for the AI API.
-   **`requests`:** For making HTTP requests (e.g., to external APIs).
-   **`BeautifulSoup4`:** For web scraping (if applicable).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (LTS version recommended) & npm (or [Bun](https://bun.sh/))
-   Python 3.8+
-   Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luisfilipemu11er/clt-agora-hub.git
cd clt-agora-hub
```

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
npm install # or bun install
```

### 3. Install Backend Dependencies

It's recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects.

```bash
python -m venv venv
./venv/Scripts/activate # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project

### 1. Start the Backend Server

Navigate to the project root and run the Flask application:

```bash
./venv/Scripts/activate # On Windows (if not already active)
source venv/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux (if not already active)

python app.py
```

The backend server should start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### 2. Start the Frontend Development Server

In a separate terminal, navigate to the project root and start the Vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev # or bun run dev
```

The frontend application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port).
